([Reference PitchBook](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/551670-49#overview))

Steven Walchek Founder and CEO had a sense that organizations didn't have the best *observability* into their employees' use of generative AI and could possibly be leaking *privatized* data.

>"We want every organization to have the ability to say yes to generative AI," said Steven Walchek, Liminal's Founder and CEO. "With Liminal, CIOs and CISOs can securely administer generative AI while protecting their most sensitive data across every use case, regardless of the model(s) they want to use."

Liminal and other generative artificial intelligence (AI), companies focus on several key metrics to *measure success*:

1. Model Quality Metrics:

    *Perplexity:* This metric assesses the model’s ability to predict the next word in a sequence. Lower perplexity indicates better performance.

    *BLEU Score:* It evaluates the similarity between generated text and reference text. Higher BLEU scores indicate better alignment.

    *ROUGE Score:* Similar to BLEU, it measures text similarity. Higher ROUGE scores imply better quality [1].

2. System Quality Metrics:

    *Latency:* The time taken for the model to generate output. Lower latency is desirable for real-time applications.

    *Throughput:* The number of requests the system can handle per unit of time. Higher throughput is advantageous.

    *Resource Utilization:* Monitoring CPU, memory, and GPU usage ensures efficient system operation [2].

3. Business Impact Metrics:

    *Business Goals Alignment:* Metrics should align with strategic business objectives. For example, if the goal is content generation, track the relevance and engagement of generated content.

    *Data-Driven Adjustments:* Use metrics to adapt and improve the model. Regularly analyze performance and adjust accordingly.

    *Stakeholder Communication:* Metrics facilitate clear communication with stakeholders about the AI project’s progress.

    *Return on Investment (ROI):* Demonstrating the value generated by the AI initiative is crucial [2].

These metrics not only assess current success but also guide continuous improvement. By monitoring model quality, system efficiency, and business impact, companies can optimize their generative AI deployments for long-term effectiveness [2][1].
